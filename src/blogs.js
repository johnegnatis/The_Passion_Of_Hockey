      "16 nhl.com writers cast their votes on their Norris Trophy picks at the end of the regular season. As Erik Karlsson ran away with the voting. His 100 points as a defensemen make him a lock for the award, but the conversation around the trophy involves multiple deserving defensemen. After Karlsson (76 points), Cale Makar (32), Adam Fox (25) Rasmus Dahlin (23), Josh Morrissey (22), Dougie Hamilton (20), and Quinn Hughes (18), The Dallas Stars’ Miro Heiskanen received a meager 11 points in the voting.",
      "Heiskanen sits tied at eighth in points for Defensemen with 71 after 77 games played. Aside from Karlsson’s 100 points, Hamilton sits in second place with 76. The top of the defensemen scoring race is tight, and Karlsson is the only one to have separated himself from the pack.",
      "So what separates Heiskanen if he is not outscoring all defensemen? The way that Hieskanen can be overlooked after his stellar season (aside from playing in Dallas) is that he excels in EVERY aspect that a defensemen can be graded at. His incredible offensive season is a departure from his previous seasons, but he is the same old anchor in the Star’s defensive zone. Hieskanen is a top defensive player in the game today, while scoring at the top of the list, while playing 25 minutes a night, while quarterbacking the first PP unit, and while leading his team into a resurgent season. Hieskanen doesn’t stand alone by far in any one category, he is just excellent at all of them. Karlsson is -21 on the year, and his defensive play can’t even pass the eye test. His achievement this year should not be discounted, but he is playing on a tanking team that can allow him to be a defensive liability. Hieskanen doesn’t cheat, he plays honestly and is consistently the best player on the ice. For 25 minutes a night.",

      "It is said to be the hardest trophy to win in professional team sports. It takes 4 series that are the best of seven. Most series are at least 5 or 6 games, so the eventual Stanley cup winner will play an additional 16-27 games to win but over 22. That is over ¼ of the regular season. This second season is at an increasing intensity. Every game is played more aggressively than the regular season, and many will go into overtime. The overtime game is sudden death, first team to score wins, but can last 1-2-3 additional periods. Injuries become a critical factor as the series is extended, and later the teams go into the next rounds. The referees are also being stretched as they must officiate very close matches, at high speeds and increasing force and physical activity.",
      "Does the best team win? It depends on your perspective. If you are a fan of old-time hockey, the toughest team will usually go farther. The referees are encouraged to let them play and not call any close calls. As a result, the ultra-competitive experienced athletes are wily and will take liberties, and as a result, the advantage goes to those that are good at being sly or sneaky. What also happens is more players are injured as less penalties are called. This is where luck sets in, as some players get injured as fewer close calls are made, and more contact is inevitable. Especially, in the later parts of the game and the third period, where one seems to have to create a seismic event to elicit a penalty. Not all referees are consistent. Some coaches will be vociferous in their complaints during the game trying to seek advantage for their team with the referee.",
      "If you’re a skilled player, and on the smaller side in stature, you are at a disadvantage at times, unless you’re super-fast, and can avoid contact. The superstars will inevitably rise to the top in the regular season, but in the playoffs, it is not always as easy as they are covered more closely. Is this fair to them? It depends again on your view.",
      "What is debatable is whether the fans that are not watching the game, want more skill or more toughness. Many fans new to the game say they don’t understand it. It is simple to understand, the fact that most goals win and there are two nets, so it must be they do not understand the rules. The game is fast, but when penalties are called, the referee announces hooking, or tripping, or high sticking, and that is all. The television crews are left to figure it out. There is no official league summary. What is so confusing is that at times the same call is made in one period and not in another. The discretion afforded the referee to control the game is totally unfair to the referee, as they have way too hard a job. The players are left confused at times. The coaches even more so. They say it all balances itself out. However, this is a cop out. It doesn’t always be in a short series, especially when the teams are so closely matched.",
      "Integrity is about trust or fairness. Strict is always fair, however, the fact that technology readily available is not used as a supplement, to the referee, is ludicrous. The fan can many times see a call missed. To say human referee error is at stake, is not a smart option. There are now two referees when there was one. Why not have a few referees in the stands and watch a video feed as well, with microphones to tell the referees on ice to call a penalty. When the players know they are being watched by so many eyes will they cheat as much? I think not. If a video of the infraction was played, after the infraction, I think the players will learn more than what is expected, but most importantly new fans will be gained. This could result in fewer powerplays but more scoring, perhaps.  The fear of getting caught must surpass the reward of getting away with an infraction to regain true control and skill. Why not allow the best players to be the best?",
      "I truly believe the sport can go to another level, if it was offered with more professionalism and technology and transparency.",

      "If you're a fan of hockey, I am sure you have heard the name Connor McDavid before. At just 24 years old, McDavid is already considered one of the best players in the NHL and is widely regarded as the future of hockey.",
      "McDavid was born in Richmond Hill, Ontario, close to the birthplace of my father, and started playing hockey at a young age. In Canada, it did not take long before everyone to know about this kid who was making waves in youth hockey. He is given the nickname McJesus as to suggest that he is simply that much better than everyone else.",
      "In 2015, McDavid was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers as the first overall pick, and he has not disappointed. It was clear from the start that McDavid was a special player. Since then, he has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Hart Memorial Trophy for the NHL's most valuable player twice (in 2017 and 2021) and the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points three times (in 2017, 2018, and 2021). He is also a five-time NHL All-Star and has helped lead the Oilers to the playoff’s multiple times.",
      "For me, what really sets McDavid apart is his incredible speed and puck handling ability. I have had the pleasure of seeing him play live and I would consider it a form of art the way he dismantles team's defenses and scores. McDavid is still young and has a long career ahead of him, but he has already cemented his place in NHL history as one of the best players of his generation. He's a true superstar and a joy to watch on the ice, and we can't wait to see what he accomplishes in the years to come.",

      "I was born and raised a Texan, but since my dad is from Canada I frequently took trips to see my relatives in Canada. Canada is very similar and very different from Texas, but one glaring different is the sports. Hockey is the #1 sport for most Canadians. And for that reason, the culture around hockey is different",
      "I grew up playing Texas hockey and we were competitive, but it does not compare to the hockey played in Canada; especially the hockey played at a young age. Canadian Youth hockey is great because everyone is playing it. There are public rinks everywhere to go practice, assuming you have the money to support it.",
      "One of the coolest things I got the privilege of experiencing is a little thing they call Shinny up north. Shinny is the equivalent of pickup basketball, just a bunch of kids playing hockey. What surprised me is that people just show up with a pair of gloves, a helmet, a stick, and some skates and duke it out without having to pay a dime. In Texas, ice time is a precious commodity that some people pay top dollar for. And although us Texans like to think of ourselves as the Wild West, we require full gear to play hockey, were as they are nude by comparison. A typical game of Shinny looks like this: The first 15 minutes everyone just shoots and passes. Then all the sticks go in center ice and somebody divides up the sticks into two groups. The remaining time is just fun, easygoing hockey. You are not able to find this sort of thing here in the Lone Star State.",

      "I have watched many sports in my life, and I cannot think of a single position that is more influential on the outcome of the game than a hockey goalie. Another impactful position that come to mind is the quarterback, who can single-handedly ruin the game for any team with poor play. However, not even this compares to the weight a hockey goalie carries. ",
      'My dad put it this way: "a good goalie can make a bad team look good, and a bad goalie can make a good team look bad." If your goalie makes a few mistakes the entire team now has the job of recovering a couple goals, which is no easy task in the low scoring game of hockey. Similarly, a goalie that is playing out of his mind can take a low tier team and make them competitive against the best teams. ',
      "I remember watching the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Dallas vs. Calgary in the first round. The Dallas Stars were by FAR the worse of the teams, and most had counted them out. But their rookie goalie Jake Oettinger had other ideas. Jake put his team on his back, making 40-50 saves a game and nearly upsetting the Calgary Flames. The series ended up going to game 7 and Calgary won in OT. That night Oettinger played out of his mind. The score 3-2 in favor of Calgary; the shots: 67-28.",
